# Course Recommendation System

## Overview

The Course Recommendation System is a project that leverages Coursera course data and a fine-tuned GPT-3 model to provide personalized course recommendations and learning roadmaps. Additionally, it uses cosine similarity to recommend further courses based on a user's past interests and preferences.

## Features

- **Course Recommendations:** The system offers personalized course recommendations based on a user's profile and interests, enhancing their learning journey on Coursera.

- **Learning Roadmaps:** Users can receive customized learning roadmaps that guide them through a structured learning path, ensuring they acquire the necessary skills and knowledge.

- **Cosine Similarity:** The system utilizes cosine similarity to suggest additional courses that align with a user's historical course selections and preferences, fostering continuous learning and skill development.

## Technologies Used

- **Python:** The core programming language for developing the recommendation system.

- **GPT-3:** A fine-tuned GPT-3 model is used for natural language processing and generating personalized recommendations and roadmaps.

- **Coursera Dataset:** Real-world course data from Coursera is used to create a robust recommendation engine.
